//Break 
/*
break pushes the control outside the current loop's scope,


continue skips just that 1 iteration when the condition is met.
For ex: to print numbers from 1 to 10 and you put break when i = 5;
then break will print till 1-5 , and continue will print 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,
Continue will ignore 5.
