  /* Benefits of IIFE
Avoid Global Namespace Pollution: IIFE helps in preventing variable clashes in the global namespace.
Creates Private Scope: All variables inside the IIFE are private to that function scope and not exposed to other parts of the code.
Encapsulation: Useful when building libraries or modules where you want to expose only certain functionality.
Executes Immediately: IIFE runs immediately after it is created, making it useful for initialization tasks.
Drawbacks of IIFE
Readability: Some developers find IIFE syntax harder to read, especially for newcomers to JavaScript.
Debugging: If not named, debugging can be harder since anonymous functions donâ€™t appear in stack traces with a name. */
