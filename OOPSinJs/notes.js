/*
JS is a prototype based lang and classes are basically a syntactic sugar over
existing prototype based mechnaisms , it is to ease the developers from different languages.

OOP- programming paradigm (paradym)

object: collection of properties(variables) and methods(fnc)

why oops?
->clean code , reduce messy code

Parts/components of OOP:

-Object literal 
-Constructor fncn
-Prototypes
-Classes
-Instances (new,this)

4 Pillars:
Abstraction : Hiding internal details
Encapsulation :  Wrapping methods fncs
Inheritance : Parent to chid
Polymorphism : single method does various work
